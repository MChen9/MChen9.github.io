### My Course Project
------
**Movie Reviews Classifier on Java**
*Sep - Dec 2018*
- Developed a system for evaluating perceived trustworthiness of users by feeding raw movie reviews text and user profiles text, text lengths are around 100 words, implemented on Java
- The system carries out dynamic web crawler, data storing in SQlite, automatically labeling, tokenization, vectorization, similarity calculation, feature engineering, training and prediction, reached average of 85% accuracy

**Machine Learning Packages Development on Python**
*Sep - Dec 2018*
- Implemented Neural Network, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, TAN, Logistic Regression, based on Numpy and Pandas
Temporal Convolutional Network on TensorFlow Oct - Dec 2018
- Implemented the state-of-art model TCN for analysing sequence data, including 1D convolution, dilated causal convolu-
tion and residual connection by TensorFlow
- Compared performance of TCN with that of LSTM/GRU over sequence modeling tasks, e.g. MNIST, P-MNIST, Adding
Problem, achieved 96% accuracy
- Implemented TCN to solve tweet sentiment analysis problem

**TSP Delivery Software in Madison on GAMS**
*Oct - Dec 2017*
- Developed a software for a restaurant to deliver pizza to the customers in Madison using minimal time and resources
- Implemented Dynamic Programming to find shortest path and visualized trajectory on Python, solved the delivery model
by GAMS, integrated the software on Linux
- Solution verification: average cost per delivery decreases by 16.43%, according to previous data
